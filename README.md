# 🎵 Music Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Music Recommendation System** that suggests songs based on user preferences and listening history. It leverages **Machine Learning** techniques and **data analysis** to generate personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends songs similar to a user's listening history.
- 🤖 **Collaborative Filtering** – Uses other users' preferences to suggest songs.
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Analyzes and presents music trends.
- 🎼 **Audio Feature Extraction** – Uses metadata like tempo, genre, and mood for recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data handling and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn** – For implementing ML algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For code execution and visualization.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization.
